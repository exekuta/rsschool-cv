## Brief info about me:
35 years old, engineer and father of 2 sons :) Currently I live and work in Kazan.<br>
During my studies at the university (in the early 2000s) I was engaged in the development of simple websites, freelance projects. Later when I worked in the Ministry of culture I developed interactive teaching materials **(HTML, CSS, Flash)**. After graduation, I got a job at the Kazan helicopter plant and still work there.<br>
For a long time I studied 3D modeling **(Maya, Zbrush, Blender, Substance 3D)** and was engaged in level design on the **Unreal Engine 4**.<br>
But at the moment I want to return to web development again.
## Programming skills:
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JS;
- **Frameworks:** React;
- **Version control systems:** GitHub, GitLab;
- **IDE:** VSCode
## Code example:
**[Complementary DNA](https://www.codewars.com/kata/554e4a2f232cdd87d9000038/) kata from CodeWars:**

> *In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).*

**My solution:**
```javascript
function DNAStrand(dna){
  return dna
    .split('')
    .map(function(currentValue){
      switch (currentValue) {
          case 'A': return 'T'
          case 'T': return 'A'
          case 'C': return 'G'
          case 'G': return 'C'
      }
    })
    .join('');
}
```
